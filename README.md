# Hamming Code Implementation
This project is a web-based implementation of Hamming Code, which allows users to:
- Encode a given binary input using Hamming Code.
- Introduce an error at a specified position.
- Detect the error position using Hamming Code error detection.

## Features
- Accepts 4, 8, or 16-bit binary inputs.
- Encodes data using Hamming Code with appropriate parity bits.
- Allows the user to introduce an error at a specified position.
- Detects and displays the position of the introduced error.

## Important Notes
The input binary sequence MUST be entered from MSB (Most Significant Bit) to LSB (Least Significant Bit).
- Example: If you want to encode 10011100,
  - The leftmost bit (1) is the Most Significant Bit (MSB), and the rightmost bit (0) is the Least Significant Bit (LSB).
